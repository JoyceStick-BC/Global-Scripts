    SceneLoader is responsible for asynchonously loading a Scene using any loading mode.  The
    idea is to delagate the loading of the new scene to Unity's dedicated background process.
    We can periodically query the state of the loading and display it.  The scene is loaded in
    Normal mode by defaut, so that the previously loaded scene is closed.  When all assets are loaded,
    the scene is activated and the previous scene is unloaded.

    This custom process should minimize the performance drop on the scene that is currently being
    played and reduce the lag from activating a scene.

    We will need to investigate further:
        1. Is loading the scene in Additive mode necissary if loading is separated from activating?
        2. Do the background processes significantly change game performance, which is critical when
            using VR HMDs?
